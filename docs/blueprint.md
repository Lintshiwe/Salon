## Style Guidelines:

- Dominate the website with various shades of pink, inspired by Barbie's iconic style. Use bright, saturated pinks for primary elements and softer, pastel pinks for backgrounds and accents.
- Incorporate gradients of pink to create a dynamic and playful feel throughout the site.
- Use a playful and stylish font that reflects the Barbie aesthetic. Consider a rounded sans-serif font for headlines and a clear, legible font for body text.
- Employ whimsical and fun icons that complement the overall theme. Use icons with rounded edges and a touch of sparkle to enhance the Barbie-inspired look.
- Create a dynamic and engaging layout with elements that pop and stand out. Use asymmetrical designs and unexpected placements to add visual interest.
- Incorporate a high degree (90%) of UI/UX animation throughout the website. Animate the background with subtle, moving patterns and use lively transitions between pages.
- Add interactive elements with delightful animations, such as sparkling effects on hover or playful animations on button clicks.
