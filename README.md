UI Component Library: Reusable, accessible React components (e.g., buttons, modals, forms) for consistent design and fast UI creation.
AI Integration: Simplified setup for advanced AI models like Grok 3.0, enabling intelligent features and interactions.
Tailwind CSS Customization: Cohesive design system with support for dark mode, dynamic styles, and responsive layouts.
Backend & Deployment: Firebase hosting, admin workflows, and content management tools for streamlined deployment and updates.
Developer-Centric Architecture: Modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase for rapid development and future growth.

Project Structure
The project follows a modular and scalable structure to support rapid development and maintainability. (Detailed structure not provided in the document, but implied as a premium section.)

Notes on the Documentation
Styling Customization: The document mentions options like header alignment, table of contents style (bullets), logo generation, and emoji additions for headings, but no specific configurations are detailed.
Premium Sections: "Features" and "Project Structure" are marked as premium sections, suggesting they may require additional access or configuration in GitDocify.
Missing Information: The {test_framework} placeholder in the testing section indicates an unresolved variable. Common frameworks for TypeScript/React projects (e.g., Jest, Vitest) might apply, but confirmation would require further context.
Page 2 Issue: The repeated "Git" entries on page 2 appear to be an OCR error or irrelevant content, so they were excluded.
AI Model Reference: The document mentions "Google Gemini 2.0" on page 3, which seems inconsistent with typical AI model naming or availability as of June 2025. This might be a typo or placeholder for another model
